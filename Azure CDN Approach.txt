We can implement this functionality using Azure CDN 

Azure CDN can help in delivering contents to User/Clients by caching content at physical Nodes.
For this implementation Prerequisites are
1) Azure Subscription, Azure Storage Account
2) CDN Profile, CDN Endpoint
3) Azure CDN Profile Level, it will cost as per profile level  

How it will be implemented 
1) Need to create Resource on azure Portal using Front Door and CDN Profile
2) In CDN Profile, needto select Subscription and resource group
3) Once Profile created, open resource and create EndPoints
4) Host Website in Azure, in CDN profile select App Service-> out Website
5) Web App-> Networking->Azure CDN
6) We can put CSS, Images folder in our Web App
7) Content Path for Files should be same as CDN Endpoint
 like http://<appname>.azurewebsites.net/Img/Image1.jpeg
      http://<endpointname>.azureedge.net/ImgImage1.jpeg
8)In browser open URL
http://<endpointname>.azureedge.net/index.html
9) we can see same page that we ran in an Azure web app. 
Azure CDN has retrieved the origin web app's assets and is serving them from the CDN endpoint.
10) Need to Purge the CDN in Azure Portal
